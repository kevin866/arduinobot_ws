[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsoridl_default_generators.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "soridl_default_generators", but CMake did not find one.
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also "/home/parallels/arduinobot_ws/build/arduinobot_msgs/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "soridl_default_generators" with any of the following names:

    soridl_default_generatorsConfig.cmake
    soridl_default_generators-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "soridl_default_generators" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "soridl_default_generators_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "soridl_default_generators" provides
  a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
